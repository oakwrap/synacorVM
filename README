SYNACOR VM - by Oak Wrap (we are computing!)
--------------------------------------------
vm.scm - run with (run) in a repl (geiser). Expects to see "challenge.bin" in same directory.

A implementation in Guile Scheme.

Hope to return to this as it was a really fun puzzle. Lots more to explore.
Many thanks to @ericwastl and Synacor. https://challenge.synacor.com/

- ! SPOILERS BELOW ! -







The teleporter :
teleporter.scm - run with (call-cf)

    Did not realize this was Ackermann's function until after giving up on an algebraic solution and reading other solutions. Implemented a pretty standard version and tried to add caching with a hash table. This could definitely be improved. Would also like to try Guile's threading to speed things up.


The orb :
orb.scm - run with (dogrid)

    Randomly walking between squares until it finds a solution. The count can be reduced (down to 12) until a solution is returned that works. Brute force but generally returns in a few seconds.
